# What the fuck are you trying to pull here Kimmy?

It's harmless and silly. Don't freak out. Maybe I'll write a better README at some point, but there's more info in the script itself.

## Files
- **`index.html`**  
  This is the bash script. Yes it does have an html extension.

- **`access.html`**  
  The landing page you'll see if you're not using `curl`. I burned 17 trees using AI to get it to look this nice.

## Fancy Redirects
I use a redirect rule to send anything that isn't  `"User-Agent: curl*"` to the `access.html` page. Super fancy.

Stop piping stuff from the internet to bash.
